# Cminer
Cminer was made for ease of use combined with privacy and security. So far, the first part of the project has been created. This is the site that will house the download to the algorithm, as well as it will house information about mining, such as how to get started, what you need to get started; witch would be what computer components, and it will tell you how to put the components together. The website's primary purpose is to give newcomers into the crypto mining space a chance to catch up on everything all in one place. Things to come in the future: An algorithm, mobile app, quick start page, and a tutorial on building a mining rig.
